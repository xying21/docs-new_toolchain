## Overview

CKB SDK is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote CKB node by using JSON-RPC. CKB SDK encapsulates cryptographic algorithms and RPC services to support the development of applications on CKB. The knowledge of CKB Data Model (see [Nervos CKB Reference](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/introduction) and [CKB RFC: CKB Data Structures](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0019-data-structures/0019-data-structures.md)) and [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/tree/develop/rpc) are crucial in developing applications by using this SDK.

Now CKB SDK is implemented by the following programming languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust and Swift.

* [ckb-sdk-js](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-js)

  ckb-sdk-js is an SDK implemented in JavaScript, and published in [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-core/), and provides APIs for developers to send requests to the CKB blockchain. Neuron Wallet utilizes ckb-sdk-js .

* [ckb-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-ruby)

  ckb-sdk-ruby is an SDK implemented in Ruby and provides APIs for developers to send requests to the CKB blockchain. CKB-Explorer utilizes ckb-sdk-ruby.

* [ckb-sdk-java](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-java)

  ckb-sdk-java is an SDK implemented in Java and provides APIs for developers to send requests to the CKB blockchain.

* [ckb-sdk-go](https://github.com/ququzone/ckb-sdk-go)

  ckb-sdk-go is an SDK implemented in Golang.

* [ckb-sdk-rust](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-rust)

  

* [ckb-sdk-swift](https://github.com/ashchan/ckb-swift-kit)

  ckb-sdk-swift is an SDK implemented in Swift and provides APIs for developers to send requests to the CKB blockchain. Testnet Faucet utilizes ckb-sdk-swift .
