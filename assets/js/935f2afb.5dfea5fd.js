To alter the state of an existing cell, one just destroys the original cell, then create a new one in a single, atomic transaction. CKB scripts, running on CKB VM, actually perform series of validation rules on the input cells and output cells of the transaction.","sidebar":"Reference"},"reference/transaction":{"id":"reference/transaction","title":"Transaction","description":"Transactions are the most fundamental entities for interacting with Nervos CKB.
